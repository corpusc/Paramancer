# Paramancer
Multiplayer, frantic, OLD SCHOOL arena FPS.     Using Unity/C#.    Soon with roguelike mode.    Eventually with thousands of 
BALANCED procedural weapons


This version of the game was abandoned about 4 years ago.
I restarted making Paramancer from scratch, and it will remain closed source.
I will pull out a few small bits of code (that were authored by me) from this code base, but most of my work here was simply
re-architecting the original code base to be more readable, flexible and extendable.  Also changing the graphics from the blocky 
Minecraftish aesthetic.  And completely remaking the HUD, UI/menus & player control (fully remappable & customizeable controls & 
features such as FOV sliders).

***** Sophie Houlden's game "Splat Death Salad" *****

Something that is mentioned in-game and in the code is that I started this project from that source code.
It was a very impressive, fully functioning multiplayer FPS game with a number of game modes.  Coded in just 7 days for the 7DFPS game
jam.

I talked with Sophie & she gave me permission to use this as a base for Paramancer, which I clearly told her was meant to be a commercial
game.  She gave me permission to use it, with no obligation to pay her anything!  THIS DOES NOT EXTEND TO ANYONE ELSE ON GITHUB.  You 
would have to discuss it with her, and I imagine she would PROBABLY give you the same permission, but DO NOT ASSUME THIS!

As for me & my former coding collaborator's newly coded features, we both don't care if you want to use THAT code for any 
reason (you'd have to ask me about what part you would like to use).  But you MUST GET PERMISSION FROM SOPHIE if you want to use this project's code in a commercial game!  

The newer gun models were made by a 3rd guy, and I'm fairly sure he would NOT give you permission to use them, as he had some weird financial ideas with me, which (and combined with other more personal reasons) caused me to stop using his guns and to stop communicating with him.

Every part of the code that I read and interacted with was virtually entirely rewritten.  Almost no identifiers kept the same name, for 1 example.


2 things lead to abandoning this code base.

[1] Despite being very clear about the fact that I was to be %100 in control of all design & artistic decisions for the game, 
the coder that I was collaborating with (& who agreed to this) kept arguing with me and immediately undoing changes I made (or modifying them in weird ways that I hated).  I was constantly having to undo & fix game design changes he was making, and it was time consuming to study his changes and basically undo %80 of them.  This had a negative exponential effect with the other reason:

[2] Despite all the work I put into refactoring the original SDSalad code, it seemed like a never-ending task.  And I felt that there
would always be some remaining ghosts in the code.  That the whole flow would be drastically different from something that I built up
myself from scratch, even if it ended up %100 different code from SDSalad (and I think it would have if I had continued).
